    <h1 id="Page-Header">Intro to css</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="Introduction">This is my introduction to css in this I will go deeper into my understanding of the syntax and selectors as well as tips for easier use as well as possible combinations.</div>
    <h2>Universal selector</h2>
    <div class="Universal-selector">The universal selector will select elements of any type. The syntax for it is an asterisk. For example I appled the background color purple to my html webpage using a universal selector and the whole page was set to purple.</div>
    <h2>Class selector</h2> 
    <div class="class-selector">To the best of my knowledge this selector is mainly used to select HTML elements with the class. It seems that it is the most commonly used selector because it can replace the p element and perform the same function.</div>
    <h2>Type selector</h2>
    <div class="type-selector">A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element. For example if you create a container for the div element and set the color to red all elements in the html file will follow the instruction. </div>
    <h2>ID selector</h2>
    <div class="ID-selector">From my understanding it is very similar to the class selector in the sense that it will select all elements of the given element. The major difference is that an element can only have one ID and cannot be repeated.</div>
    <h2>Combining selectors</h2>
    <div class="grouping-selector"></div>
